# Qiskit Aqua Machine Learning Tutorials and Samples

Qiskit Aqua Machine Learning is a set of tools, algorithms and software for use with quantum computers to 
carry out research and investigate how to take advantage of quantum computing power to solve machine learning
problems. 

Qiskit Aqua Machine Learning translates machine-learning-specific problems into inputs
for a quantum algorithm residing in Qiskit Aqua, which in turn uses [Qiskit](https://www.qiskit.org/) for the relevant
quantum computation. 

This folder contains some Jupyter Notebook examples. There are Python code files too.
