# Qiskit Ignis Examples

This collection of notebooks contains examples for how to use the various 
components of [Qiskit Ignis](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ignis). 
The examples are run on Qiskit Aer, but can easily be ported to any backend.

The examples are ordered in the standard steps to calibrate and characterize
a system. Advanced examples are in the advanced folder.

Further examples and in-depth explanations can be found in the community repo
[Ignis Community](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-community-tutorials/tree/master/ignis).
